Add this Webpart to a modern page in SharePoint to make underling Columns from the Page available to 
other Webparts through Webparts dynamic data interface. You can use this to build a Search Result (adding the PnP Modern Search Results Webpart)
based on your Pages meta data Fields. 

This Project is currently in an experimental status.

This Webpart adds the ability to make your column Data directly available to SPFX Search Webpart. 
It adds the ability to select between AND and OR for multi value columns. 

Wiki will be updated soon.
